%Challenges - 

%Overall, the challenges I faced within this coursework task include
%building the breadboard of the arduino to work with my thermistor, and
%finding a way to ensure the LEDs in task 2 could pulse without intefering 
% with the main loop. The main issue with the thermistor was finding a way
% to stop it from overheating and therefore intefering with results. I
% fixed this issue by introducing a resistor. The main challenge with the
%LEDs were allowing the loop of the blinking lights to be run without it
%distrupting the main loop. If I run the blinking lights in an infinite
%loop, the program would never return to the top of the main loop to run it
%again. This was fixed by only blinking the lights twice or 4 times so the
%main loop could be run again.

%Strengths

%My strengths mainly lay with the flowchart drawing. This is because it
%allowed me to visualise the coding and the eventual running of the
%program, and made the development process much smoother. Another strength
%was the design of the LED section of the breadboard; I understood the
%function of the LEDs and their circuits and so could neatly lay out the
%components to allow for better debugging.

%Limitations

%My codes only limitation is the blinking of the LEDs in task 2. The
%periods between the blinking of the lights isnt completely constant as the
%last loop of the for loops within the if statements result in the main
%loop being run again. This extra code means that the delay is slightly
%longer than 1 second.

%Suggested future improvements

%One improvement I could make would be making the blinking of the LEDs more
%consistent. This could have been done with the use of a function or just
% more efficient code. Another improvement would be simplifying the file 
%creation in task 1. Instead of writing the file within 24 lines of code, 
%I could havelaid it out much better to print the information much more 
%efficiently.
